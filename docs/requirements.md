# Project Requirements

## Scope

In this project we will develop a command-line interface (CLI). That allows
users to experiment with different Bayesian Time Series models. The CLI
will provide a user friendly interface for users to input their data and
select the models they want to experiment with. The CLI will also provide
options for users to save and reuse their models.

## Stakeholders

- Data Scientists
- Machine Learning Engineers

## User Requirements

- As a data scientist I want to be able to input my time series data into the CLI
  so that I can apply it in different applications.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to try different Bayesian Time Series
  models on my data so that I can find the best model for my data.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to save and reuse my models so that I
  can avoid retraining them every time I want to use them.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to reproduce my results so that I can
  ensure the reliability of my models.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to visualize the results of my models
  so that I can understand how they perform.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to modify an existing model so that I
  can experiment with different configurations without starting from scratch.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to predict future values using my
  trained models so that I can make informed decisions based on the model's predictions.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to modify the prediction horizon so
  that I can control how far into the future I want to predict.
- As a data scientist I want to be able to compare the performance of different
  models on my data so that I can choose the best one.

- As a machine learning engineer I want to be able to integrate the CLI with my
  existing workflows so that I can use it in my projects.
- As a machine learning engineer I want to be able to have separate commands for
  training, predicting, and evaluating models so that I can use them in my
  scripts.
- As a machine learning engineer I want to be able to use the CLI in a
  distributed environment so that I can scale my experiments.
- As a machine learning engineer I want to be able to use the CLI in a
  production environment so that I can deploy my models.
- As a machine learning engineer I want to be able to use the CLI to monitor
  the performance of my models so that I can ensure they are performing as expected.
- As a machine learning engineer I want to be able to use the CLI to produce
  logs so the I can debug issues in my models.
