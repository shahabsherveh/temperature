  abstract = "PyMC is a probabilistic programming library for Python that
              provides tools for constructing and fitting Bayesian models. It
              offers an intuitive, readable syntax that is close to the natural
              syntax statisticians use to describe models. PyMC leverages the
              symbolic computation library PyTensor, allowing it to be compiled
              into a variety of computational backends, such as C, JAX, and Numba
              , which in turn offer access to different computational
              architectures including CPU, GPU, and TPU. Being a general modeling
              framework, PyMC supports a variety of models including generalized
              hierarchical linear regression and classification, time series,
              ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and non-parametric models
              such as Gaussian processes (GPs). We demonstrate PyMC's versatility
              and ease of use with examples spanning a range of common
              statistical models. Additionally, we discuss the positive role of
              PyMC in the development of the open-source ecosystem for
              probabilistic programming.",

  journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
  abstract = {Changes in the global production of major crops are important
              drivers of food prices, food security and land use decisions.
              Average global yields for these commodities are determined by the
              performance of crops in millions of fields distributed across a
              range of management, soil and climate regimes. Despite the
              complexity of global food supply, here we show that simple measures
              of growing season temperatures and precipitation—spatial averages
              based on the locations of each crop—explain ∼30% or more of
              year-to-year variations in global average yields for the world’s
              six most widely grown crops. For wheat, maize and barley, there is
              a clearly negative response of global yields to increased
              temperatures. Based on these sensitivities and observed climate
              trends, we estimate that warming since 1981 has resulted in annual
              combined losses of these three crops representing roughly 40 Mt or
              $5 billion per year, as of 2002. While these impacts are small
              relative to the technological yield gains over the same period, the
              results demonstrate already occurring negative impacts of climate
              trends on crop yields at the global scale.},
